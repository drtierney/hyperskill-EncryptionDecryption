# hyperskill-EncryptionDecyption
Developing a command line application which can encrypt/decrypt strings using various encryption algorithms. https://hyperskill.org/projects/46

**Stage #1 Encrypted**
Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.

**Stage #2 Knowledge is key**
Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher. 

**Stage #3 Decrypted!**
Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table.

**Stage #4 I Command you**
Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.

**Stage #5 X-files**
Work with files; learn to store your data in a file.

**Stage #6 Choices, Choices**
Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.
